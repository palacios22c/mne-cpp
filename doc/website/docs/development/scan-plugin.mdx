# Creating a New Plugin

MNE Scan's functionality is extended through plugins. Each plugin is a shared library that is loaded at runtime. This guide shows how to create a new MNE Scan plugin.

## Getting Started with the DummyToolbox

The easiest way to create a new plugin is to start from the **DummyToolbox** template:

1. Copy the `dummytoolbox` folder under `src/applications/mne_scan/plugins/dummytoolbox`.
2. Rename the folder and all files to match your new plugin name.
3. In all source files, replace `DummyToolbox` / `dummytoolbox` with your plugin name.
4. Update the `CMakeLists.txt` inside your new plugin folder with the correct target name and source files.
5. Register your plugin in the parent `src/applications/mne_scan/plugins/CMakeLists.txt` by adding an `add_subdirectory()` call for your plugin folder.

The DummyToolbox source can also be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-cpp/tree/main/src/applications/mne_scan/plugins/dummytoolbox).

## Plugin Structure

A typical MNE Scan plugin consists of:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `myplugin.h / .cpp` | Main plugin class — inherits from the appropriate abstract base class |
| `myplugin_global.h / .cpp` | Shared export/import macros |
| `myplugin.json` | Plugin metadata (name, version) |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | Build configuration |
| `FormFiles/` | Optional Qt Designer `.ui` files for the plugin GUI |

## Plugin Types

MNE Scan distinguishes between three plugin categories:

- **Sensor plugins** (acquisition): Provide data from hardware devices or simulations. See [Acquisition Plugins](scan-acq.mdx) for the architecture pattern.
- **Algorithm plugins** (processing): Apply real-time processing to the data stream (e.g., filtering, averaging, source localization).
- **IO plugins** (output): Write data to disk or forward it to other systems.

Each category has a corresponding abstract base class in `src/applications/mne_scan/libs/scShared/`.

## Building and Testing

After adding your plugin, rebuild MNE-CPP with CMake:

```bash
cd build
cmake --build . --target myplugin
```

The compiled plugin library will be placed in the output directory where MNE Scan can discover it at runtime.
