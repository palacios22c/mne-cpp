# MNE Scan Development

MNE Scan is the real-time data acquisition and processing application in MNE-CPP. Its functionality is organized as a plugin pipeline, where data flows from acquisition plugins through processing plugins to output plugins.

The guides in this section cover how to extend MNE Scan with your own plugins:

- **[Acquisition Plugins](scan-acq.mdx)** — Architecture of sensor/driver plugins that interface with hardware devices.
- **[Creating a Plugin](scan-plugin.mdx)** — Step-by-step guide to building a new MNE Scan plugin using the DummyToolbox template.
