# MNE Analyze Development

MNE Analyze is the offline data analysis and visualization application in MNE-CPP. It uses a plugin architecture where all functionality — data loading, filtering, visualization, source localization — is implemented as plugins that communicate via an event system.

The guides in this section cover how to extend MNE Analyze:

- **[Creating a Plugin](analyze-plugin.mdx)** — Detailed guide to implementing a new MNE Analyze plugin, including GUI elements, menus, and controls.
- **[Event System](analyze-event.mdx)** — How plugins communicate with each other using the built-in event manager.
- **[Data Model](analyze-datamodel.mdx)** — How to create new data models for loading and displaying custom data types.
