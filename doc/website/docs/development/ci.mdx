# Continuous Integration

MNE-CPP uses a fully automated CI pipeline to ensure that every change to the codebase is validated across all supported platforms before it is merged.

The CI system combines three key components:

- **[GitHub Actions](ci-ghactions.mdx)** — The CI platform that runs all build, test, and deployment workflows automatically on every pull request and push.
- **[Unit Testing](writingtest.mdx)** — Tests that verify individual functions and components produce correct results.
- **[Deployment](ci-deployment.mdx)** — How release binaries are packaged and published for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **[Release Guide](ci-releasecycle.mdx)** — The step-by-step process for creating a new stable release.

Contributors should follow the [contribution workflow](contr-guide.mdx) to ensure their changes pass all CI checks before requesting a review.
