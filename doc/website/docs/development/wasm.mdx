# WebAssembly

MNE-CPP can be compiled to [WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://webassembly.org/), enabling MNE Analyze and other applications to run directly in a web browser without installation.

The Wasm build uses the [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) toolchain together with Qt's WebAssembly target, configured through CMake.

- **[Testing via CI](wasm-testing.mdx)** — How to deploy and test Wasm builds using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.
