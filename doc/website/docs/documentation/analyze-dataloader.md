# Data Loader

The data loader can be accessed from the `File` menu on the top left, as seen in the image below. From there you can load and save `.fif` files.

As files get loaded they are added to the [Data Manager](analyze-datamanager.md). Currently the data loader supports loading raw `.fif` files.
