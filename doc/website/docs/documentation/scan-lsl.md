# Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)

This plugin adds support for LSL data streams to MNE Scan. MNE-CPP includes a self-contained LSL library under `src/libraries/lsl` that implements the core LSL protocol (stream discovery via UDP multicast, data transport via TCP), eliminating the need for any external dependency.

For more information about the original LSL project please see:

* [LSL on Github](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer)

## Building the LSL Plugin

The LSL plugin is built by default. Configure the project as usual:

```
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```

No external submodule or library is required — the built-in `mne_lsl` library provides all necessary LSL functionality.

## LSL Plugin Setup

* Build MNE Scan.
* Start MNE Scan — the LSL adapter plugin will be available in the sensor plugins list.
