MNE Inspect is a 3D brain visualization and source analysis application. It provides an interactive viewer for FreeSurfer-reconstructed cortical surfaces, BEM models, source estimates, sensor layouts, functional connectivity networks, and evoked sensor-field maps — all within a single, integrated GUI.

## Getting Started

Launch MNE Inspect from the command line:

```bash
mne_inspect [options]
```

The application opens with the default MNE sample dataset. You can specify your own data via command-line options (see below) or load files interactively through the GUI controls.

## Command-Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--subjectPath <path>` | Path to the FreeSurfer subjects directory | `<app>/resources/data/MNE-sample-data/subjects` |
| `--subject <name>` | Subject name | `sample` |
| `--bem <path>` | BEM surface file (FIFF) | — |
| `--trans <path>` | Head-to-MRI transformation file (FIFF) | — |
| `--stc <path>` | Source estimate file (can be repeated for multiple STCs) | — |
| `--digitizer <path>` | Digitizer / sensor layout file (FIFF) | — |
| `--srcSpace <path>` | Source space or forward solution file (FIFF) | — |
| `--atlas <path>` | Atlas annotation file (lh or rh; the sibling hemisphere is auto-detected) | — |
| `--evoked <path>` | Evoked / average data file (FIFF) | — |

### Example

```bash
mne_inspect \
  --subjectPath /data/subjects \
  --subject sample \
  --stc /data/sample-stc-lh.stc \
  --bem /data/subjects/sample/bem/sample-5120-bem.fif \
  --trans /data/sample-trans.fif \
  --atlas /data/subjects/sample/label/lh.aparc.annot
```

## Features

### Cortical Surface Visualization

- Load and display FreeSurfer-reconstructed surfaces (inflated, pial, white, sphere, etc.)
- Switch between surfaces at runtime via the **Surface** combo box
- Apply different shader modes for surface rendering
- Toggle left and right hemisphere visibility independently

### Atlas Overlays

- Load FreeSurfer atlas annotations (e.g., `aparc`, `aparc.a2009s`)
- Overlay parcellation regions on the cortical surface with color coding
- Both hemispheres are loaded automatically when one is specified

### BEM Models

- Load and display the three BEM layers: inner skull, outer skull, and head surface
- Toggle individual layers on or off
- Separate shader control for BEM surfaces
- Optional fixed-color mode for BEM rendering

### Source Estimates (STC)

- Load and visualize MNE/dSPM/sLORETA source estimate time courses
- Animated playback with adjustable speed (0.25x – 4x)
- Real-time accurate playback mode with fractional sample stepping
- Configurable colormap (Hot, Hot Negative, Jet, Bone, Red-Blue, Cool-Warm)
- Adjustable threshold controls (min, mid, max) for activation display
- Timeline scrubbing via slider
- Support for loading multiple STC datasets and switching between them

### Sensor and Digitizer Visualization

- Load sensor layouts and digitizer points from FIFF files
- Toggle visibility by sensor type: MEG, EEG
- Toggle digitizer point categories: cardinal, HPI, EEG, extra points
- Apply head-to-MRI coordinate transformation in real time

### Dipole Fitting Results

- Load and display dipole fit results
- Toggle dipole visibility

### Source Space

- Load and display source space points from a forward solution file
- Toggle source space visibility

### Functional Connectivity Networks

- Visualize connectivity networks in 3D
- Adjustable threshold slider to filter network edges by strength
- Configurable network colormap

### Evoked Data and Sensor-Field Mapping

- Load evoked / averaged data files
- Display MEG and EEG sensor-field interpolation on the scalp surface
- Show contour lines for MEG and EEG fields
- Visualize the MEG sensor helmet (convex hull or point cloud)
- Timeline scrubbing synchronized with STC playback (optional)

### Sensor-Field Streaming

- Stream sensor data with configurable modality (MEG / EEG)
- Adjustable averaging window
- Loop mode for continuous playback
- Configurable colormap for sensor-field display

### Multi-Viewport

- Support for multiple simultaneous 3D viewports (1–4)
- Independent camera control per viewport
- Camera presets (e.g., anterior, posterior, left, right, dorsal, ventral)
- Per-viewport editing target selection

## Usage

The simplest way to get started is to launch MNE Inspect directly from the command line or by double-clicking the executable. When started without any arguments, the application opens with an empty scene and you can load data interactively through the GUI — use the toolbar buttons and file dialogs to add surfaces, overlays, sensors, or any other supported data type one at a time. You can also pass individual files via the [command-line options](#command-line-options) listed above to pre-load specific datasets on startup.

For day-to-day work, however, you typically want to inspect a complete subject context at once — cortical surfaces together with BEM meshes, source estimates, sensor positions, coordinate transforms, and evoked data. Assembling all of those `--stc`, `--bem`, `--digitizer`, … flags by hand quickly becomes tedious. This is where the **convenience launch scripts** come in.

### Quick Launch Scripts

The source tree ships with ready-made scripts that launch MNE Inspect with **all** MNE sample-data files pre-loaded — surfaces, BEM, STC, digitizer, atlas, source space, evoked, and coordinate transform — so you can start exploring immediately without assembling a long command line.

| Platform | Script |
|----------|--------|
| macOS / Linux | `src/applications/mne_inspect/run.sh` |
| Windows | `src/applications/mne_inspect/run.bat` |

#### What the Scripts Do

1. **Locate the build** — resolve the `mne_inspect` executable relative to the script directory (supports both flat builds and macOS `.app` bundles).
2. **Set data paths** — default to `~/mne_data/MNE-sample-data` (or `%USERPROFILE%\mne_data\MNE-sample-data` on Windows). Override by setting the `MNE_DATA_PATH` environment variable.
3. **Auto-discover STC files** — scan the `processed/` subdirectory for all `*-lh.stc` files and pass each one via `--stc`. If no processed STCs exist, the script falls back to the original `sample_audvis-meg-eeg-lh.stc`.
4. **Launch with full context** — the final command line includes `--subjectPath`, `--subject`, `--bem`, `--digitizer`, `--trans`, `--srcSpace`, `--atlas`, `--evoked`, and all discovered `--stc` arguments.

#### Running the Scripts

```bash
# From the project root (macOS / Linux)
./src/applications/mne_inspect/run.sh

# Or point to a custom data location
MNE_DATA_PATH=/data/my_mne_sample ./src/applications/mne_inspect/run.sh
```

```bat
:: From the project root (Windows)
src\applications\mne_inspect\run.bat

:: Or with a custom data location
set MNE_DATA_PATH=D:\data\my_mne_sample
src\applications\mne_inspect\run.bat
```

:::tip
The scripts are a good starting point for creating your own launch configurations. Copy one and adjust the paths to load your own subject, BEM, and STC files.

## Dependencies

MNE Inspect depends on the `mne_disp3D_rhi` library and is only built when this library is available. It also links against `mne_fs`, `mne_fiff`, `mne_fwd`, `mne_mne`, `mne_disp`, `mne_inverse`, `mne_utils`, and `mne_connectivity`.
