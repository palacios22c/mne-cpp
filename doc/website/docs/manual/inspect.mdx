# MNE Inspect

MNE Inspect is a 3D brain visualization and source analysis application. It provides an interactive viewer for FreeSurfer-reconstructed cortical surfaces, BEM models, source estimates, sensor layouts, functional connectivity networks, and evoked sensor-field maps — all within a single, integrated GUI.

## Getting Started

Launch MNE Inspect from the command line:

```bash
mne_inspect [options]
```

The application opens with the default MNE sample dataset. You can specify your own data via command-line options (see below) or load files interactively through the GUI controls.

## Command-Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--subjectPath <path>` | Path to the FreeSurfer subjects directory | `<app>/resources/data/MNE-sample-data/subjects` |
| `--subject <name>` | Subject name | `sample` |
| `--bem <path>` | BEM surface file (FIFF) | — |
| `--trans <path>` | Head-to-MRI transformation file (FIFF) | — |
| `--stc <path>` | Source estimate file (can be repeated for multiple STCs) | — |
| `--digitizer <path>` | Digitizer / sensor layout file (FIFF) | — |
| `--srcSpace <path>` | Source space or forward solution file (FIFF) | — |
| `--atlas <path>` | Atlas annotation file (lh or rh; the sibling hemisphere is auto-detected) | — |
| `--evoked <path>` | Evoked / average data file (FIFF) | — |

### Example

```bash
mne_inspect \
  --subjectPath /data/subjects \
  --subject sample \
  --stc /data/sample-stc-lh.stc \
  --bem /data/subjects/sample/bem/sample-5120-bem.fif \
  --trans /data/sample-trans.fif \
  --atlas /data/subjects/sample/label/lh.aparc.annot
```

## Features

### Cortical Surface Visualization

- Load and display FreeSurfer-reconstructed surfaces (inflated, pial, white, sphere, etc.)
- Switch between surfaces at runtime via the **Surface** combo box
- Apply different shader modes for surface rendering
- Toggle left and right hemisphere visibility independently

### Atlas Overlays

- Load FreeSurfer atlas annotations (e.g., `aparc`, `aparc.a2009s`)
- Overlay parcellation regions on the cortical surface with color coding
- Both hemispheres are loaded automatically when one is specified

### BEM Models

- Load and display the three BEM layers: inner skull, outer skull, and head surface
- Toggle individual layers on or off
- Separate shader control for BEM surfaces
- Optional fixed-color mode for BEM rendering

### Source Estimates (STC)

- Load and visualize MNE/dSPM/sLORETA source estimate time courses
- Animated playback with adjustable speed (0.25x – 4x)
- Real-time accurate playback mode with fractional sample stepping
- Configurable colormap (Hot, Hot Negative, Jet, Bone, Red-Blue, Cool-Warm)
- Adjustable threshold controls (min, mid, max) for activation display
- Timeline scrubbing via slider
- Support for loading multiple STC datasets and switching between them

### Sensor and Digitizer Visualization

- Load sensor layouts and digitizer points from FIFF files
- Toggle visibility by sensor type: MEG, EEG
- Toggle digitizer point categories: cardinal, HPI, EEG, extra points
- Apply head-to-MRI coordinate transformation in real time

### Dipole Fitting Results

- Load and display dipole fit results
- Toggle dipole visibility

### Source Space

- Load and display source space points from a forward solution file
- Toggle source space visibility

### Functional Connectivity Networks

- Visualize connectivity networks in 3D
- Adjustable threshold slider to filter network edges by strength
- Configurable network colormap

### Evoked Data and Sensor-Field Mapping

- Load evoked / averaged data files
- Display MEG and EEG sensor-field interpolation on the scalp surface
- Show contour lines for MEG and EEG fields
- Visualize the MEG sensor helmet (convex hull or point cloud)
- Timeline scrubbing synchronized with STC playback (optional)

### Sensor-Field Streaming

- Stream sensor data with configurable modality (MEG / EEG)
- Adjustable averaging window
- Loop mode for continuous playback
- Configurable colormap for sensor-field display

### Multi-Viewport

- Support for multiple simultaneous 3D viewports (1–4)
- Independent camera control per viewport
- Camera presets (e.g., anterior, posterior, left, right, dorsal, ventral)
- Per-viewport editing target selection

## Dependencies

MNE Inspect depends on the `mne_disp3D_rhi` library and is only built when this library is available. It also links against `mne_fs`, `mne_fiff`, `mne_fwd`, `mne_mne`, `mne_disp`, `mne_inverse`, `mne_utils`, and `mne_connectivity`.
