# Filtering

The filter plugin lets you select the parameters for filtering the data in the signal viewer. For a basic filter, just input the range of frequencies you want to let you filter pass and select `Activate filter`. The data displayed in the signal viewer will reflect your filter settings, which can be changed in real time.
