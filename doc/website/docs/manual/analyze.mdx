# MNE Analyze

:::caution Under Development
MNE Analyze is currently being ported to MNE-CPP and is not yet feature-complete compared to the original MNE-C `mne_analyze` application.
:::

MNE Analyze is a GUI application for comprehensive sensor- and source-level analysis of pre-recorded MEG/EEG data. It provides tools for data visualization, preprocessing, source localization, and interactive exploration of results. It currently supports the `.fif` (FIFF) file format.

MNE Analyze offers a completely modular work area, with plugins and viewers that can stack, snap to sides, or act as separate windows.

It also has two user modes, **Clinical** and **Research**, and two view styles, **Default** and **Dark**. These can be selected from the `Appearance` menu.

## Plugin Architecture

MNE Analyze uses a plugin-based architecture. The following plugins are currently available:

| Plugin | Description |
|---|---|
| **Data Loader** | Loading FIFF data files |
| **Data Manager** | Managing loaded datasets |
| **Raw Data Viewer** | Browsing raw time-series data |
| **Annotation Manager** | Event marking and annotation |
| **Averaging** | Computing evoked responses |
| **Filtering** | Data filtering |
| **Channel Selection** | Selecting channel subsets |
| **Co-registration** | MEG/MRI coordinate alignment |
| **Scaling** | Signal amplitude scaling |
| **Dipole Fit** | Interactive dipole fitting |
| **Real-time** | Connection to real-time data streams |

## Planned Features

The original MNE-C `mne_analyze` provided extensive functionality that is planned for future MNE-CPP releases:

- Full 3D visualization of source estimates on cortical surfaces
- Interactive ROI (Region of Interest) definition
- Time-frequency analysis displays
- Connectivity visualization
- Movie generation of source activity
- Surface morphing and group analysis visualization
