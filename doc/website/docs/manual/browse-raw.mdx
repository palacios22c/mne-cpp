# MNE Browse Raw

:::caution Under Development
MNE Browse is currently being ported to MNE-CPP and is not yet feature-complete compared to the original MNE-C `mne_browse_raw` application. The information below describes the planned functionality.
:::

## Overview

`mne_browse` is a GUI application for browsing and visualizing raw MEG/EEG data stored in FIFF format. It provides interactive viewing of multi-channel time-series data with tools for navigation, scaling, filtering, and channel selection.

## Planned Features

- Interactive scrolling through raw MEG/EEG data
- Adjustable time scale and amplitude scaling
- Channel selection and grouping
- Real-time filtering display
- Bad channel marking
- Event/trigger display
- SSP projection toggling
- Data annotation

## Current Status

The basic browsing functionality is available through the `mne_browse` application. For more comprehensive raw data browsing and analysis capabilities, consider using the **[MNE Analyze](analyze)** application or **[MNE Scan](scan)** for real-time data viewing.
